## UniRide

### Overview
A project made in collaboration with three other team members, including a junior. Throughout the process, we've gained insights on how to manage team projects efficiently. It's a unique blend of a matching app and a taxi dispatch app.  
*(概要: 後輩と私含めた4人でのチーム制作の作品。チームでのプロジェクト進行のノウハウを学びながら作成。内容はマッチングアプリ × タクシー配車アプリ。)*
